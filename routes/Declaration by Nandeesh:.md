Objections and Responses List
Point 7:

Objection: It is incorrect to state that my father or I demanded any assets during the finalization of the marriage. This claim is completely false and baseless.
Question: As per the objection in Point 7, it was mentioned that there was an agreement to transfer property to Vidhya's name. Was there also an agreement to return the property after my investment? This information appears incomplete—please clarify.
Point 8:

Objection: This point contains false information.
Request: Please provide supporting documents to substantiate this claim.
Point 9:

Objection: We have independently covered our own expenses, and no funds were received from the other party. This claim is untrue.
Point 11:

Objection: Please provide all documents regarding the property in my name, specifically plots numbered 43/1, 43/2, and 43/6.
Request: Please provide proof of the claimed ₹11 lakhs agricultural income.
Request: Please provide proof of ownership of a 30x40 site purchased with my income.
Point 12:

Objection: My employment depends on my skillset and qualifications, and it is unfounded to claim otherwise.
Question: Why did you not take further steps, such as moving to separate housing or filing complaints, if abuse was an issue? This timing suggests ulterior motives, as these claims are being made only after the divorce proceedings began.
Point 13:

Objection: If I struggled to adjust in your parents’ home, why did you not move into our matrimonial home or file a police complaint earlier? Given your educational background and family’s involvement in law enforcement, this claim appears inconsistent.
Point 14:

Objection: How can you attribute your health issues to me without medical evidence? There is no record, MLC, or report indicating that my actions caused your health problems.
Question: If I showed no interest in our child, who admitted our child to school, and who paid the fees and medical expenses until 2023, including vaccinations and newborn hospital expenses?
Point 16:

Objection: You visited my native place only three years after marriage, staying for only three months. Can you substantiate your claims of harassment with documentary evidence such as complaints, MLCs, or case filings?
Point 17:

Question: Why involve extended family in our marital issues? Why not resolve these matters privately within the marriage?
Point 18:

Objection: You have claimed that I demanded assets and money, which is untrue. I have never demanded any assets from you or your family, and my financial contributions are well-documented.
Point 19:

Objection: We did not demand any of your family’s property, nor have we taken any support from you or your family.
Request: Please provide documentation if you have proof that we made any such demands.
Point 20:

Question: You stated that I forced you to stay in my rented house. Who initially obtained the rented house, and why did your family join without invitation?
Point 21:

Question: Who enrolled our child in school? Was it you or me? If it was you, please provide evidence of payments and admissions.
Point 22:

Objection: We never agreed to provide financial support for your house. Why would my family be expected to finance your family’s property?
Question: You stated that the relationship ended due to financial issues—please clarify your intentions regarding the demands for money.
Point 23:

Question: Why have you not visited our matrimonial home or spent school vacations with me if I was interested in divorce? My filing for conjugal rights under Section 9 demonstrates my commitment to our marriage.
Point 24:

Question: If I have invested my money, why would I initiate quarrels? Do you have documented proof of abuse from me?
Point 25:

Question: Why did you not pursue legal action previously if any misconduct occurred?
Point 26:

Objection: It is inaccurate to label me as an alcoholic without evidence.
Request: If you claim financial issues as the basis of our marital discord, please explain why I filed for conjugal rights and child custody. I have provided significant financial support and have not received any funds from you.
Point 27:

Objection: Financial planning, including income tax management, is my right and does not indicate misconduct.
Point 28:

Objection: When you demanded money and forced me out, you refused to return my belongings, including 200 grams of jewelry, two laptops, and my clothing.
Point 29:

Objection: Restricting my access to our child impacts my ability to contribute to their welfare.
Request: If you require financial support for our child, grant co-custody or visitation rights under court supervision, which I am willing to fulfill.
Point 30:

Question: If there was an agreement in the panchayat, why did you not join me in rented housing afterward?
Point 31:

Question: Why do you believe you have exclusive rights over our child? Why did you not respond to my legal actions seeking custody?
Point 32:

Request: Allow me to access academic records and information about my child without undue restriction. This denial of access adds to the emotional distress.
Point 33:

Question: Changing the father’s contact information to another family member is inappropriate. I am the child’s biological father—please provide evidence to justify any other listing.
Point 34:

Objection: Claiming mistreatment without support from third-party evidence, such as complaints or MLCs, is unfair and misleading.
Point 35:

Question: Why did your parents attempt to create divisions within my family?
Point 36:

Objection: Recording harassment is within my rights to document the mistreatment I’ve experienced.
Point 37:

Objection: I am ready to continue our marriage, provided you are willing to join me at my home. Any misconduct on my part can be addressed under court guidance.
Point 38:

Objection: You and your family have used derogatory language toward me. My filing for conjugal rights is not a harassment tactic but an attempt to preserve our marriage.
Point 39:

Objection: Legal actions I have taken are intended to resolve our issues, not to harass you.
Point 40:

Request: We have not received any notification regarding a transfer filing from the court.
Conclusion:
Site 26 was initially intended for my brother, but due to unforeseen issues, I purchased it with his funds, and he later reimbursed me. I transferred the property accordingly.
